                <p>To the uninitiated, meal planning can feel like an elusive practice</p>
                <p>or an overwhelming task, but that’s usually because we think</p>
                <p>about meal planning from the endpoint — when all the recipes</p>
                <p>have been selected, when all the groceries have been shopped for</p>
                <p>, and a week of dinners was successfully made. Put all the</p>
                <p>information in front of a newbie and their eyes grow wide with one</p>
                <p>resounding question: But how do I do it?</p>

                <p>What it is: Meal planning is asking the what’s for dinner question</p>
                <p>once for the whole week, instead of every night, and then</p>
                <p>shopping for and prepping the ingredients before cooking. We</p>
                <p>believe the simplest way to approach meal planning is with three</p>
                <p>steps.</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>Select your dinners and their recipes, if needed.</p>
                    <p>Shop for ingredients.</p>
                    <p>Prepare those ingredients.</p>
                </ol>

                    <p> “Every meal should end with something sweet. Maybe it’s jelly on</p>
                    <p>toast at breakfast or a small piece of chocolate at dinner – but it</p>
                    <p>always helps my brain bring a close to the meal.” ~ Robert Irvine</p>
